       "\"teacher are punctual but they should also give us the some practical knowledge other than theortical Good  Excellent lectures are delivered by teachers and all teachers are very punctual. Good teachers give us all the information required to improve the performance. Yes good and punctual It is good Good Good It's good when compare with my Btech lectures and teaching activities. Good way of teaching is good University teaching here is very much dependent upon slides,though it is a easy way of teaching but still leaving some concepts unclear..otherwise interaction with the faculty is good.Lecture delivery sometimes is not upto the mark and punctuality is  fine.  Good Good  As compared to other colleges and university our university is perfect in all the aspects Good Lectures helps in clear our concept Talk about punctuality, it's really good but the lecture delivery is somehow not appreciated because every teacher has different style of teaching, so lack of knowledge in terms of subject is there and interaction is also kind of boring. A teacher should be entertaining as well but they are really not. All they want us to be studios and disciplined which is really not the thinking of every student. University is very good at delivering proper lectures,also the interaction with students is descent. Sometimes the teachers lack in terms of punctuality but overall university is giving a good input.  Good Good lecturer are punctual and can interact them easily. Good Good Punctuality is good. Most of the teachers are not interacting with students . Good nice lecture delivery is not so good It's good Discipline, punctuality , lecture delivery all are good but hv to do some work for quality of lecture Interaction is very good,accurate supplement material is provided but recommendation of books is very poor,the change of a particular teacher after 3 months or a semester of same subject causes problems Perfect It is really gud Very good teaching and management but too much load on student and working hours in terms of lecture delivery that is good.in terms of punctuality that is also good but in terms of intraction that is very bad. There are some teachers they donot interact and do not litsn our problms that means they do not coprate. According to me everything is going well in accordance to interaction.More than enough is served.  Very good teaching and management but too much load on student and working hours not effective and satisfactory in terms of lecture delivery by all the faculty . Good Good Accurate It's good Good it is good depending on the faculty maintained punctuality, good lecture delivery average average good good good good average good it is quite good , depending on teacher and their experience it is quite good , depends upon teacher and their experience the way of teaching is good but the time more than enough good teaching delivery good, teacher is delivery the lecture in the best way they can good and qualified teachers but few lacks in interaction with students and fails to describe a topic average very good teaching facilities, lecture given are fruitful and teachers are punctual interaction is good but not with mostly male lecturers.punctuality is maintained by everyone but lecture delivery not peak quality. all things are good all things are good all activties are good all activties are good good All is good. no other university is so serious about the concept of practicals. lecture delivery depends on teacher's knowledge, punctuality is good Good way of teaching is average not so good average good the staff is highly punctual ad interactive and encourage students to participate in the class staff and faculty members are always available for interaction, very punctual and delivery of lecture can be improved good delivery good our university is good in terms of lecture delivery,interaction and punctuality good very good good interaction satisfied, lecture delivery good,punctuality always on time Excellent but it depends upon teacher good good Good good Good Good  very good. it is ok some teachers aren't doing their jobs in very well manner Some of the teachers are not well experienced but they are interactive and helpful and punctual. not all the teachers are teaching well but it's fine EXCELLENT The faculty is good ,interaction between student and teacher is also good not good Good Good some of our faculty member are not so experienced that's why most of the time we are facing problems subjects like CSE(c++) good its to good  everything is good  everything is good but when coming to some lectures who dont have a good grip on subject,they dont behave well with students and they dont even teach all the concepts in the subject.  excellent everything was good regarding to university but, some lecturers don't have grip on the subject and lag in the teaching normal good good teaching activities of our university is good. i am satisfied with it. GOOD everything is good for faculty satisfactory GOOD all are good good but not good . sir improve the subject The university is good but it also has a long way to go. More teachers should have their PhD and college fests related to academic curriculum must be improved to a great extent and must be managed properly.The interaction is good, lecture delivery needs more lucidity. The punctuality is top notch. our university is good in punctuality,lecture delivery but it is not good in terms of interaction average interaction is very less ,when it comes to lecture delivery its fine but the co cordination not there between the lectueres good All lectures are giving their best to teach the students our university is very good but in terms of interaction of teachers wd students is not at all fair because they interact wd only students understands his/her teaching they don't make remaining students to understand the topic  The university consists of a whole world in itself.It is diverse and manages to conduct all events properly.I love being the part of this university where we get equal and all opportunities in all respects and fields. teachers are pretty interactive,But it all depends on the student to gain as much as knowledge he can from the teacher.Teachers are punctual and very helpful during exams time. teaching delivery is good .but it is better to reduce there speed of  lecture delivery to understand the student better overall rating on this activity is 4.5/5 .very nice teaching and interaction between students and lectures was good, every time there will be new and fresh style in  delivering the lectures ,thanks.\\n\\n\\n  excellent, but reduse the speed of teaching  ,up to understand the students teaching is ok but the interaction with the students need to improve, i mean they have to focus on dull students more  than intelligents.... Interaction is good but it should b more ...rest is too perfect teachers are good in subject,and punctuality Everything would be fine if there are less number of students in our btech CSE. good  faculties are doing quite well but need more senior lecturers. satisfied examination department is not good, teaching is quite good, I cant get extra time for extra knowledge, interaction is good\\n\\n\\n Well and Good Good good university management is extordinary but some of the faculty is very bad good good good some lectures are excellent,but not everyone It is very good learning in this university its  booring good Good teaching is good but some lecturers are showing partiality between south people and north people excellent teaching is good but some teachers are not able to interact properly and are not able to clear the concepts properly, teachers are punctual. \\n good Everything is very good. Interaction part is something like teachers mostly interact with each and every student, lecture delivery is very good and punctuality always maintains. good I am very much satisfied with teaching faculty interms of iteraction,lecture delivery, punctuality etc they are showing partiality between north indians and south indians good Interaction is satisfying, Lecture delivery is Good, Punctuality is Excellent\\n\\n staff is showing partiality between north indians and south indians  excellent university  the mode of teaching is completely different than any other university in india. lecturers are very friendly with every one they interact just like friends and they are very punctual lecture delivery and punctuality was good but the interaction with students was not good. punctuality and lecture is good here but interaction isn't good. good enough In this university there is good interaction with the students, Teachers in this university can deliver the lectures effectively, There is good punctuality in this university\\n\\n Very good indeed.  Teaching is excellent,but lecture delivery is not up to the mark.Punctuality is good interaction of some faculty was good but not all faculty.. good, and also like the teaching style Interaction between students and teachers is good ,The lectures delivery is fine, punctuality is good\\n \\n\\n not bad Its Quite Good very good indeed not bad.. teaching is good some lecturers are showing partiality between south people and north people I WAS A STUDENT OF A BOARDING SCHOOL .....(jnv) I STUDIED FOR 7  YEARS THERE RESIDING IN HOSTEL ..NOW LIVING IN LPU IS SAME LIKE THAT..AND STILL MORE SAME AND PUNCTUALITY IS SHOWN HERE BY BOTH TEACHERS AND STUDENTS...AND ALSO BY THE STAFF..          SECURITY IS ABOVE 90%(IN CASE OF  STUDENT IS WELL MANURED)  ....CLASSES REGULAR ....SPORTS DAILY.....PARTICIPATION WELL/.......QUALITY BELOW AVERAGE All terms are good regarding the university activities GOOD intraction is good and leacture delivery also good and then punctuality is also is good all the given terms are good regarding the university  All the terms are good regarding the university activities. Some of the teacher are un experienced. Also they are unfair and baised. Infact many of the teachers are having few or no experience about the subject  IT IS GOING GOOD\""

very good but in term of interaction of teacher wd student is not at all fair because they interact wd only student understands his her teaching they don t make remaining student to understand the topic the university consists of a whole world in itself it is diverse and manages to conduct all event properly i love being the part of this university where we get equal and all opportunity in all respect and field teacher are pretty interactive but it all depends on the student to gain a much a knowledge he can from the teacher teacher are punctual and very helpful during exam time teaching delivery is good but it is better to reduce there speed of lecture delivery to understand the student better overall rating on this activity is very nice teaching and interaction between student and lecture wa good every time there will be new and fresh style in delivering the lecture thanks excellent but reduse the speed of teaching up to understand the student teaching is ok but the interaction with the student need to improve i mean they have to focus on dull student more than intelligents interaction is good but it should b more rest is too perfect teacher are good in subject and punctuality everything would be fine if there are le number of student in our btech cse good faculty are doing quite well but need more senior lecturer satisfied examination department is not good teaching is quite good i cant get extra time for extra knowledge interaction is good well and good good good university management is extordinary but some of the faculty is very bad good good good some lecture are excellent but not everyone it is very good learning in this university it booring good good teaching is good but some lecturer are showing partiality between south people and north people excellent teaching is good but some teacher are not able to interact properly and are not able to clear the concept properly teacher are punctual good everything is very good interaction part is something like teacher mostly interact with each and every student lecture delivery is very good and punctuality always maintains good i am very much satisfied with teaching faculty interms of iteraction lecture delivery punctuality etc they are showing partiality between north indian and south indian good interaction is satisfying lecture delivery is good punctuality is excellent staff is showing partiality between north indian and south indian excellent university the mode of teaching is completely different than any other university in india lecturer are very friendly with every one they interact just like friend and they are very punctual lecture delivery and punctuality wa good but the interaction with student wa not good punctuality and lecture is good here but interaction isn t good good enough in this university there is good interaction with the student teacher in this university can deliver the lecture effectively there is good punctuality in this university very good indeed teaching is excellent but lecture delivery is not up to the mark punctuality is good interaction of some faculty wa good but not all faculty good and also like the teaching style interaction between student and teacher is good the lecture delivery is fine punctuality is good not bad it quite good very good indeed not bad teaching is good some lecturer are showing partiality between south people and north people i wa a student of a boarding school jnv i studied for year there residing in hostel now living in lpu is same like that and still more same and punctuality is shown here by both teacher and student and also by the staff security is above in case of student is well manured class regular sport daily participation well quality below average all term are good regarding the university activity good intraction is good and leacture delivery also good and then punctuality is also is good all the given term are good regarding the university all the term are good regarding the university activity some of the teacher are un experienced also they are unfair and baised infact many of the teacher are having few or no experience about the subject it is going good'"

Good good every thing is fine It's appreciable Satisfied The books that are recommended do not contain appropriate content; leads the students to depend on slides given by teachers. Hence the knowledge remains superficial Awesome It is proper Courses are very good and useful  Its good Everything is fine.

Courses are very good and useful  content is good enough Good Good Accurate Accurate Perfect the material provided is beneficial and provides much knowledge fully knowledgeable good good well planned good good ok good average content is very knowledgable and gives us huge knowledge of every subject content is enough, we donot need more. good quallity content but some teachers donot upload ppts on time course content is good the content of the course is knowledgeable subjects are appropriate but much depth is required as syllabus includes only basics not the details good some courses are irrelevant as they are not related to my stream. there are many courses which are irrelevant to the branch. some topics are not covered. There is no proper material for any course not too bad not too bad course material is perfect not bad good IP is provided to the students which is very helpful for the students. depth of course is less on the other hand knowledge and material is good Good content does not provide deep knowledge average sometime it is irrelevent with the ongoing courses. average(in one term there should be only two major subjects based on numerical) some of them are very helpful and knowledgeable and some are just formality very knowledgeable, some subjects do not have dedicated material like books available optimum content good very good good very good it is not appropriate Satisfied knowedgeable and proper course material Good, but there should be at least one a practical subject in every semester Yes good Good good Good Good  good. it is not very deep course contents are very much relevant to our courses The course structure is good and follows todays technology. Some subjects portion are too vast and are difficult to cover in 1 sem good GOOD content of the course is good  syllabus is not in debth Excellent Very good as per the courses all the sub are providing  worth knowledge very good i dont know regarding the courses everything is good coming to the courses these are very well planned... and it all depends on the lectures. good good good good upto the mark It is so good. GOOD excellent content of course is ample but depth must be more COURSE IS GOOD NO PROPER COURSE MATERIAL excellent good Content of the courses should be changed a bit. More of industry oriented feature like Linux and GitHub must be implemented. Proper detailing and advanced knowledge is required and is to be instilled in the students.The course material is good. good it was knowledgeable,depth of the course is good,there is but proper course materials in only for some  subjects average good good Excellent very good and you can also increase the standard of Courses The courses available in the university have got a scope and the teaching of these courses goes on with the point of view of bringing out the best from the student by indulging them in different activities and projects. content of course is more than enough to get the basics of that particular subject. courses are also good .but lt of subjects in cse departments at 1st year it feels like burden upon us  my rating in this is 4/5 good,they work very hard for us good syllabus is more which required time ..it should b less so that student can proper concentrate getting the knowlegde instead of just covering the syllabusgood good when compared to other universities we need better material and exposure. good the content of the course should be increased with the depth. content provided by you is excellent so that we learnt more and more about that particular subject content of course is appropriate  The content of course should be increase with depth Good good In my opnion very less content is their in our syllabus..it will be good if there is more syllabus and depth included in our syllabus some of the faculty are not uploading ppts ok good excellent it is good learning these courses its very tough and very diffcult to understand Nice yeah! well some of the faculty are not teaching well but the schedule of the university are superb ... and university asked feedback from us .that is really helpful good The content of the courses are good but depth of courses are not enough to get the good concepts. content is sufficient for us  excellent Content of courses are good, these are very knowledgeable, depth of course is also there but sometimes proper course material is not there. good I like communication classes,courses are good they are giving good knowledge for us Excellent Knowledgeable is Good, Depth of course is satisfying, proper course material is also good\\n\\n its good every thing is good subjects have a very good depth almost all the  books are available   in the library and more than that 4/5 good Its nice . not good  The material provided in this university is depth of course, The courses in this university is knowledgeable\\n The depth of course is very much  deep. According to me its very essential Some subjects are good and predictable.Remaining courses are not satisfactory depth  of course was good ....providing a basic knowledge not so deep in subjects....at least they should provide deep knowledge and syllabus in core subjects... I like this very much because every subject is linked up with real life situations and every thing in the subject is use full depth of the course are depended on the level of student intake, course material is delivered after the class in UMS \\n\\n good Pretty Good  Is good not good enough.. we want something more. good LESS TIME FOR STUDY ...LESS TIME FOR PAPER ATTEMTING...LESS TIME FOR EVERY THING ....LESS KNOWLEGE.....LESS DEPTH OF COURSE .....BUT PROPER COURSE MATERIAL ACCORDING TO EXAM knowledge is maximum gained by reading books also the teachers explain depth if we are interested to know about it. HAVE TO IMPROVE every one can tell depth of course but some one only give notes we are getting maximum knowledge  Knowledge is maximum gained  by reading books and also teachers explain the concept in depth. Its fine but it should focus more towards practical knowledge rather than content based. It would be helpful for us. HAVE TO IMPROVE\""

       "'content of course are average not good all course material provide very good knowledge in depth content of course is perfectly in line with the teaching philosophy that is being perpetuated here i e cramming rote learning content of course improves my knowledge yes good this semester university ha provide best teacher need some improvement need some improvement knowledge and depth of the course is good but while coming to the material it s not upto the mark knowledge depth of course is good but course material are not upto the mark course content is knowledgeable content of the course is good but some course need improvement course material is not upto the mark good very good material of the course is not good enough sometimes proper course material is not required easily available course material with sufficient knowledge gaining the material or link provided for study purpose is good clarity in depth of course but again it differs from teacher to teacher the course note are very knowledgeable and proper good good content of the course are update and mostly based on current technology need some improvement good teacher are not giving depth of course they trying to cover there work only good good every thing is fine it s appreciable satisfied the book that are recommended do not contain appropriate content lead the student to depend on slide given by teacher hence the knowledge remains superficial awesome it is proper course are very good and useful it good everything is fine every thing is taught in depth even a single point is elaborated enough to understand course are very good and useful content is good enough good good accurate accurate perfect the material provided is beneficial and provides much knowledge fully knowledgeable good good well planned good good ok good average content is very knowledgable and give u huge knowledge of every subject content is enough we donot need more good quallity content but some teacher donot upload ppts on time course content is good the content of the course is knowledgeable subject are appropriate but much depth is required a syllabus includes only basic not the detail good some course are irrelevant a they are not related to my stream there are many course which are irrelevant to the branch some topic are not covered there is no proper material for any course not too bad not too bad course material is perfect not bad good ip is provided to the student which is very helpful for the student depth of course is le on the other hand knowledge and material is good good content doe not provide deep knowledge average sometime it is irrelevent with the ongoing course average in one term there should be only two major subject based on numerical some of them are very helpful and knowledgeable and some are just formality very knowledgeable some subject do not have dedicated material like book available optimum content good very good good very good it is not appropriate satisfied knowedgeable and proper course material good but there should be at least one a practical subject in every semester yes good good good good good good it is not very deep course content are very much relevant to our course the course structure is good and follows today technology some subject portion are too vast and are difficult to cover in 1 sem good good content of the course is good syllabus is not in debth excellent very good a per the course all the sub are providing worth knowledge very good i dont know regarding the course everything is good coming to the course these are very well planned and it all depends on the lecture good good good good upto the mark it is so good good excellent content of course is ample but depth must be more course is good no proper course material excellent good content of the course should be changed a bit more of industry oriented feature like linux and github must be implemented proper detailing and advanced knowledge is required and is to be instilled in the student the course material is good good it wa knowledgeable depth of the course is good there is but proper course material in only for some subject average good good excellent very good and you can also increase the standard of course the course available in the university have got a scope and the teaching of these course go on with the point of view of bringing out the best from the student by indulging them in different activity and project content of course is more than enough to get the basic of that particular subject course are also good but lt of subject in cse department at 1st year it feel like burden upon u my rating in this is 4 5 good they work very hard for u good syllabus is more which required time it should b le so that student can proper concentrate getting the knowlegde instead of just covering the syllabusgood good when compared to other university we need better material and exposure good the content of the course should be increased with the depth content provided by you is excellent so that we learnt more and more about that particular subject content of course is appropriate the content of course should be increase with depth good good in my opnion very le content is their in our syllabus it will be good if there is more syllabus and depth included in our syllabus some of the faculty are not uploading ppts ok good excellent it is good learning these course it very tough and very diffcult to understand nice yeah well some of the faculty are not teaching well but the schedule of the university are superb and university asked feedback from u that is really helpful good the content of the course are good but depth of course are not enough to get the good concept content is sufficient for u excellent content of course are good these are very knowledgeable depth of course is also there but sometimes proper course material is not there good i like communication class course are good they are giving good knowledge for u excellent knowledgeable is good depth of course is satisfying proper course material is also good it good every thing is good subject have a very good depth almost all the book are available in the library and more than that 4 5 good it nice not good the material provided in this university is depth of course the course in this university is knowledgeable the depth of course is very much deep according to me it very essential some subject are good and predictable remaining course are not satisfactory depth of course wa good providing a basic knowledge not so deep in subject at least they should provide deep knowledge and syllabus in core subject i like this very much because every subject is linked up with real life situation and every thing in the subject is use full depth of the course are depended on the level of student intake course material is delivered after the class in ums good pretty good is good not good enough we want something more good le time for study le time for paper attemting le time for every thing le knowlege le depth of course but proper course material according to exam knowledge is maximum gained by reading book also the teacher explain depth if we are interested to know about it have to improve every one can tell depth of course but some one only give note we are getting maximum knowledge knowledge is maximum gained by reading book and also teacher explain the concept in depth it fine but it should focus more towards practical knowledge rather than content based it would be helpful for u have to improve'"

Questions should emphasize more on concepts rather than testing brain's cramming storage house. examination pattern is good Yes Good I like the question pattern Good Good This university is far better than other university when coming to the exam pattern,marks disturbation and while coming to paper checking no biased corrections equal to all.  Great exam pattern is good and good paper checking. Pattern and procedure of the examination is very good. Paper checking needed to be improved. Good Excellent  Good Good Good marks distribution Students can easily check there performance throught the semester Exam pattern and how it is conducted is really seems to be good but it's my first year and when I went to scrutiny for the first time it was not as per my expectations.

GOOD in examinations please try to give question papers very good GOOD AND STRICT not much good  exams conducting is very good .but paper correction is very bad The examination pattern is good. More of logic based and subjective questions to be asked which is based upon conceptual learning. Paper checking must be done in a more lucid manner because many doubts arise with the checking of OMR sheet. all these are good the best pattern of examination are in lpu . mid term percentage should be increased so that students get more choice to get success in the examinations very good Good good\\n The examination system of the university is very impressive.The sitting plan of he students is made in such a way that no 2 students of same class give the exam in same room or even sometimes same blocks.Through this students also get to know and visit different blocks of the university.The checking is also fair . Everything is pretty well organised good  very good 5/5 good for some subjects like maths and english(passage writing) the time duration neds to increase Pattern is good ...marks distribution that includes ca,mt,et ,nd attendence all that is  little complicated  good every thing is fine. good Probably the best part of university is its examination and its pattern. I have never seen this type of examination,,,,,,,very GOOD  pattern examination checking sucks here , don't knw why I get low marks even if 4 qustions are wrong . answer key of exam is absurd, discrepancy system is not advantageous, answers of exam not right, omr should be uploaded\\n\\n\\n It is best Good good examination pattern is good but,,there is blunder mistake.that is we ha no alternate to check the mistake where we have done morever no question papers also not given for discussion.so i suggest to..provide option for checking mistakes in the MCQ exams such as midterm. good ok good excellent time not sufficient good exam pattern is good  excellent!!! every thing is excllent but paper checking is not good We don't get answers key and even the question papers for our mcq exams.There should be some means by which we could recheck our answers and get to know what mistakes we have made.   exam pattern is very nice but paper checking is not at all good . good Exam pattern and marks distribution are excellent but sometimes there are some errors in paper checking. good exam  pattern is very good but if you give question papers to students it is helpful  its better Excellent Exam pattern Very good, Marks distribution good but sometimes disappointing, paper checking OK\\n\\n yeah its obviously good exam pattern is completely different the entire exams are objective oriented resumbling  the education in abroad my review is 5/5 everything was good. everything is good. excellent but checking procedure is not exceptable since we  fail to know our faults in mid term..\\n Excellent exam pattern, paper checking in this university is easy\\n\\n I don't like the -ve marking system. appart from that everything is great Returning the question paper after the exams to be expected,because to clear and clarify the doubts regarding particular subjects examination pattern was excellent good Exams are conducted upon the the basis of the revised chapters upto that point, marks distribution is appropriate, paper checking is good\\n\\n very hard papers and main concept papers Good   Not so good strict paper correction. super but paper checking is not good NICE TIMING.. That's good to have a negative marking pattern in exam but the time is not sufficient to do all the questions. EXAMPATTERN IS GOOD AND MARKS DISTRIBUTION IS ALSO GOOD AND PAPER CHECKING IS VERY HARD  exam pattern is good and marks distribution is also good but paper checking is too hard all are good  The examination pattern is good .But time is not sufficient for those questions. MCQ pattern is quite good and efficient way for evolving students. PAPER CHECKING IS VERY HARD REMAINING IS GOOD\""

pattern examination checking sucks here don t knw why i get low marks even if 4 qustions are wrong answer key of exam is absurd discrepancy system is not advantageous answers of exam not right omr should be uploaded  it is best good good examination pattern is good but there is blunder mistake that is we ha no alternate to check the mistake where we have done morever no question papers also not given for discussion so i suggest to provide option for checking mistakes in the mcq exams such as midterm  good ok good excellent time not sufficient good exam pattern is good  excellent  every thing is excllent but paper checking is not good we don t get answers key and even the question papers for our mcq exams there should be some means by which we could recheck our answers and get to know what mistakes we have made   exam pattern is very nice but paper checking is not at all good  good exam pattern and marks distribution are excellent but sometimes there are some errors in paper checking  good exam pattern is very good but if you give question papers to students it is helpful  its better excellent exam pattern very good marks distribution good but sometimes disappointing paper checking ok  yeah its obviously good exam pattern is completely different the entire exams are objective oriented resumbling the education in abroad my review is 5 5 everything was good  everything is good  excellent but checking procedure is not exceptable since we fail to know our faults in mid term  excellent exam pattern paper checking in this university is easy  i don t like the ve marking system appart from that everything is great returning the question paper after the exams to be expected because to clear and clarify the doubts regarding particular subjects examination pattern was excellent good exams are conducted upon the the basis of the revised chapters upto that point marks distribution is appropriate paper checking is good  very hard papers and main concept papers good   not so good strict paper correction  super but paper checking is not good nice timing  that s good to have a negative marking pattern in exam but the time is not sufficient to do all the questions  exampattern is good and marks distribution is also good and paper checking is very hard  exam pattern is good and marks distribution is also good but paper checking is too hard all are good  the examination pattern is good but time is not sufficient for those questions  mcq pattern is quite good and efficient way for evolving students  paper checking is very hard remaining is good'"

       "\"not satisfactory, lab work must include latest technologies Good  Lab work is properly covered in the labs by the faculty and evaluations help to learn more practical knowledge in depth.  Good practical work provides detail knowledge of theoretical work Yes Good Everything is going fine in lab . learning new things. That is good for us Good Good Lab and practical are not upto the mark. The topic which are practiced are almost already done in Btech. Not upto the mark lab improves practical knowledge Sometimes systems at labs are screwed up .Otherwise everything is  at their respected desk. Good Good Practical work is fair Good Practical and easy learning The evaluation is again bad for our CA, as one of our faculty is really weird. He gives us remarks on the basis of how we present things in front of it, he never look for the content of our answer, which is really annoying. As he expects us to deliver answer in the way he wants us to do. But how can a person do that, as people do have different mentality and they do explain themselves in different manner, so a teacher must understand that quality of a child and should give him marks on the basis of what they say not what they should say. Good. Good Good well and good infrastructure and have trending software in lab     Good Average 3 hours practical is so long. It should be of 2 hours only  Good ok ok practicle must be of 2 hours It's good \\nAlso depends on teacher's knowledge and student's interest All good Average  Too much lanlb file work Evaluation method is gud.But the content is more to write in file excellent Its good I think electrotherapy practical should be of 2 hours.That's enough I think.Rest is fine. excellent lab duration of 3 hours is very long .  Average Good Good It's good It's good lab evaluations are pretty good .they help us a lot. having good material in labs. too much good good average it is difficult to understand experiment in 1 hour good good good lab work is also good lab work is quite good lab activities are good but not satisfactory in explaining point of view. helps in improving skills lab work is nice. practical work including evaluations are good so that students can learn about practicals. laboratory provides us a good knowledge about practicals. good practical work insome labs are not upto the marks labs are good but experiments are not very informative the labs are not practically built good practical work is good good super This is the best in our university because there is no other university which takes seriously for practical work. some time lab is not proper working , some teacher's practical knowledge is less on the other side evaluations is not that much good    Good satisfactory very poor.no equipments are there poor very poor.no equipments are there lab practicals and evaluations are below average and need lot of changes and improvements lab practical work can further be improved so that it can meet industrial standards excellent work good good good very good its hard to find a computer working in lab. Students cannot save data in one single PC good Not good, becouse in lab teachers donot teach us how to work on live projects or how to make a live project. So i have ovserved that whatever teachers have been teachig us in lab that will not usefull in our future life. not good..the timing is too much for labs and syllabus is also so vast.we don't get propr revision good Good good Good Good satisfactory. i hate it very good Practical work is in interesting but different teachers evaluate in their own way. Some of the teachers in some section  give marks without taking viva and some does not give marks accordingly  good good good good Good Good as per the lab evaluation we r satisfied with  it good lab and practical work are litial good good not very good... must be improved. good very good bad good good With the help of practicals students are able to understand all the concept.so it is also good. GOOD very good good LAB IS VERY GOOD good not good...... must be improve Lab evaluations are good. it was good but it can be improved most of the teacher don't even bother about the practical performed by students.They give marks just by seeing face or something like that.\\n good  but marks are not given properly  good Excellent practicals are good but evaluations are not because they don't give enough time to work  They are conducted in proper way. Teachers are supposed to let the students know the actual use of the instruments used in the lab. excellent ...they  work hard..their way of teaching is also pretty good average 3.5/5 good In labs,the lecturers has to interact with each student to improve their knowledge, in all the ways,before giving us the work they must explain about the experiment once so that we will come to know how to perform n take precautions while doing,........\\n Good ok its fine. good More number of lab/practicals should be there to enhance practical knowledge. Here we r able to do every thing by our own with u r valuable support  pretty good Very Good Good good There are no sufficient lab equipments in the labs and the avilable euipments are also not perfect. good good good super it is good leaning in lab but the lab instruments are not properly working very bad good good labs are very interesting it is helpful to know the knowledge According to me students are doing lab only for marks . lab practical work help us to learn the things properly and evalution is also very necessary as it helps us to retain concepts good Lab or practical work is excellent and yes including evaluations also. good lab is very much helpful in lab also they are showing parilaty Good Lab evaluations are very strict good the lab evaluations are very strict  labs n practicals are good. practicals are pretty well. good There is good evaluations in lab regarding practicle  Very good Its Good lab and practical works are good..with a little draw back of faculty in connecting  the lab practical to the outside  world.. I like it soo much Lab is good the Prof explains everything before the lab begins and the Lab Asst helps us during the experiments  very strcitly they evaluted marks  Good enough very good nice..enough labs are interesting and helpful toknoe the knowledge NOT GOOD ... Labs helps to know how the work is done.It thought me a good lessons. IT IS GOOD all labs and practical going on well not bad Labs are upto the mark. Our labs do not have all facalities.  ALL PRACTICAL WORK IS GOOD\""

       "\"library facilities are good but number of books are less Not good  Library facilities are excellent in terms of good techniques that are used over there. Its the best thing i have seen in this university,albeit the behaviour of library staff is unprofessional at times. They are whimsically rude. library has huge collection of books from different authors Yes Hardworking I am satisfied with the facilities but few books are limited of  database distribution  Its required some libral in rules Its required some libral in rules Good Good good library facilities Library facilities are very good. No issues  Hardworking Good Excellent Good Good Again some of the faculties don't know how to behave otherwise it is good. Descent. Good Good library is very well managed and provide needed facilities to us Its required some libral in rules They are doing there job well Well... all the books are not avilable . If they are in library , books are in less number and strength of student are large. Good all books are not available the system in library usually does not work . so it creates a problem for us to issue the book Sometimes only book is available for some subjects\\nAnd it is reserved Its very helpful Awesome, peaceful, relaxing atmosphere All books are not available I think number of books are very less according to the students .Only 2-3 copies are available. good Thats good I think stock is not enough more books are required.  good very cooperative  Nice Good Satisfactory Fine  Fine library facilities provided are excellent good facilities average better excellent good good some books are not available. So please provide there are doing there job good all are hardworking and punctual Excellent library is awesome and rich they are good library facility is good library facilities are good for students. very good library facilities. Issuing time of book must be increased good more books should be provided and the issue period should be increased very good library facilities. Issuing time of book must be increased never went there they are good book issuing time should be increased for 2 weeks good excellent Really our library provides very good facilites for students and teachers but fine  system was not good it was directly increased upto 10.This is not a good thing. Its good and proper design Good Excellent good average average library contains all the books regarding courses and other materials and very cooperative library staff all the books are easily available and accessable and the limit of book issued need to be increased all are good good library facilities are good . Every book is available in the library good very good library facilities. Issuing time of book must be increased as per libraries, few books are not available and in computer library there are hardly 5 PCs working good Excellent books are less good Excellent excellent Good Good good. i love it i think library facilities are only for hostelers  Capacity of library is less compared to size of university. library has providing excellent facilities It will provide us various books to increase our knowledge or to understand the  concept because it is good good good Good Good duration of issuing   books from library should be changed from 1week to 2 week that would be great. absolutely fine all books are there but the thing is that the time limit is very less we have to return the book that we have issued  very fast i dont think about  very good very good. good very good good good good It is excellent. GOOD good  library facilities need to be improve by bringing some more books EXELLENT excellent good  Library facilities are the strength of this university. It is awesome. good Almost each and every books is there.But the time limit for keeping book is too much shorted.  waste ,library is not the good place to study good Good It's good but we don't find the books because their are much less number of books perfect They are good. excellent it is very nice and timings of library is good 5/5 excellent good but there is more need of keeping books of general topics about social,polity,gk,...etc other than related to subject so that we will get some knowledge about country related issues.............. Good good Books are heavily outnumbered when compared to number of students this is the only problem with library. good Insufficient books  I have no words to say about our library facilities,,,,,,,, SIMPLY AWESOME good but timings should be 24hrs insufficient books Library facility is very good but there is a problem collection of books, Available books are very less for some subjects  \\n good good enough. good rough handling books are not available librery facilities are excellent Very rough handling good library facilites are good yeah quite well but ... some of the books are not available library facilities is good good library facilty is good super Library facilities are good, it maintains silence there and makes good environment to study but sometimes it goes very strict which is not required according to me. uncertain I like reading books in Library i felt its better because there is no problem from library facilities Average Excellent     but sometimes lack of books especially during exam times libary is giving a lot to us  but we are not getting it excellent i've never went to library in lpu.so,i don't know about that. I don't know abt that bcoz i didn't go to library till now. facilities are good to overcome one's need good Required text books are not available to every student Its good library facilities are excellent...but only limited books are available ..so books should be increased. good  The library has insufficent number of books for all the students very good there we can find several course books and we can find several reference books also... Library is vast and has got wide variety of books But I think more number of specimen copies of books should be made available\\n good fine   good VERY NICE....BUT BOOKS ARE NOT AVAILABE EVERY TIME They are good. IT IS ALSO GOOD good  library facilities are not good.They are not following the rules( they are using phones in library). They are good We have a good library with all facalities. THEY IS NO PROBLEM WITH THEM\\n\""

       "\"extracurricular activities are excellent and provides best platform to students. Good  Extra curricular activities also help students to divert their mind from their study for some time. University plays an important role in this task. Complete wastage of time. Again this opinion is strictly personal and may not coincide with others. extracurricular activities increases mental and physical abilities Yes No views No idea about the extracurricular activities.  Good it provides a great platform Good it provides a great platform While coming to extracurriculum activities it's better than any other university which I had come around. Awesome ok This university is no1 in terms of extracurricular activities and in encouraging students to participate at their comfort levels.  Good Good Great job excellent Its give various opportunities and exposure This is really a good thing that events happen in our university regularly but they must be announced early so that every student can prepare themselves for participation because sometimes we get to know about most of the events when they have already been conducted. So announcement must be there. Good. Good Good extracurricular activities held in university are necessary it provides student a platform where they can improve and groom them. Good it provides a great platform Good They are really very intersting. All the students enjoys alot and get a chance to showcase there talent Good Awesome its good for refreshment  It's appreciable\\nStudents who are having interest in co curricular activities, getting a good platform All good Good but lacks audience.....as only participants can see these activities on duty leave basis Perfect All the activities are gud and appropriate for students very good Thats good but the problm is whenever in university the functions like one india, one world are held we are not alowed to go because we have to attend the classes and if we miss the classes we will gona loose the attendence and everyone knows in lpu attendnce is very important. \\nThanx Chance to go and enjoy should be given.I think it should be off when any activity like One India is there to go and enjoy.Otherwise everything is good.  very good extracurricular activies should be held when there are no classes for the students to attend so that every student can enjoy and participate in the events Good Good Good Good Good they are amazing and help to boost our stamina. increasing confidence average best good good good ok good average extracurricular activities are good. good it is, but teachers do not consider the new ones. it is good extracurrcular activities held in university is good. super, the extracurricular activities held in university. So that student can show the efforts in other fields. good and ample number of extracurricular activities take place good they are good but they should give exposure to more students and not the same. excellent I donot participate I donot participate all are enough all activities are good good More than best Its upto mark and very efficiently held in our university Good provides good platform to interested students no comments. Because when you participiate you get reappear or backlog and no time is given for exam preparation the activities are very good but no time is given to students for participation, so its of no use average lot of activities and students get exposure in games. too many activities are conducted and student get ample amount of opportunities to participate they are going excellent good good good excellent not much interested very good Excellent bcoz of lectures..we don't get time to participate.. good Average good Good Good good. very good i also want to participate in that activities but i can't take part in those activities because I'm a day scholar \\n Extracurricular activities are good and provide a  good platform. good It is good  good good Good Excellent that's  great best hahahah very good it is a good oppurtunities to many students there are many oppertunities for students .. its all upon students about how they utilize them. excellent excellent good good\\n average It is excellent. Poor some of the universities not conducted any extracurricular activities but in our university doing these it is good for our feature  good IT IS VERY MUCH USEFUL AND WE CAN PARTICIPATE IN OUR INTERESTS very good excelent Quite a lot of events are organized and students have a all round growth which is a nice thing. very good Activities are not up to the mark as  advertisement. very well good\\n Excellent  It's good but we don't get sufficient time for participating in that activities unbiased LPU gives the best opportunity for the students to show their talent. these are very usefull to students .excellent there are lot of extracurricular activites held in university but so many of them are unknown to us ,the problem is there is no such ad's viewed to us\\nmy rating is 3/5 these are very use full to the sudents forphysical activity and improvement of knowledge good Sometimes study burden is that much that we can not participate in these activities ...there should b one activity complusory for every student like all other courses  excellent it helps in building up university's reputation. good It was quite great and unique. EXTRAORDINARY they are good it was quite great and unique Very good good it is relly awesome,extirdinary and marvellous but no time to attend good good good nice good that is only good in this university good excellent..... u r the best in providing facilties and etc .. for extra curricular activities extracurricular activities are also good excellent university offers alkot of activities which is excellent on their part as students are able to explore themselves super Extracurricular activities are good. It helps people to know their talent and build up their skills. good I am really enjoying  i felt happy because it encourages our talents Excellent Outstanding better excellent  simply superb before coming to lpu i thought sports were very good n encouraging.but, there are many politics in sports especially in cricket. not every one is getting opportunities here only recommended students getting. it seems to me very good since it is a good source of interaction with other and to built a leadership quilities and to overcome our faults. They are sportive One of the best things I like about this university. The best of all. They are extraordinary extra curricular are so good. university is providing many pathways to many students....apart from education good good they are knowledgebale and helps us interacting with other students in this university there is lot of events and lot of extra curriclar activities....
